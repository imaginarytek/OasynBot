## NEXT STEPS:
1. For each event, fetch 1s SOL/USDT price data from Binance Spot
2. Measure lag from news timestamp to first price impulse
3. Verify correlation (does price move match expected sentiment?)
4. Build final dataset with only verified events (<60s lag)
5. Create new table in database for curated events
