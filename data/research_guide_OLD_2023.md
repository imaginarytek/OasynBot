## Event Template

Copy this to `verified_events_batch.json` for each event you verify:

```json
{
  "title": "EXACT HEADLINE FROM SOURCE",
  "timestamp": "2023-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX+00:00",
  "source": "@username or outlet",
  "source_url": "https://...",
  "category": "Crypto/Regulatory/Political/Other",
  "verbatim_text": "Copy-paste exact text...",
  "time_to_impact_seconds": 5,
  "notes": "Any observations"
}
```

## Gold Standard Checklist

Before adding an event to the dataset, verify:
- ✅ Source timestamp is within ±60s of price spike
- ✅ Verbatim text is >50 characters (real content, not just headline)
- ✅ Source is tier-1 (official, Bloomberg, Reuters, major exchange)
- ✅ Timestamp is in ISO8601 format with timezone
- ✅ time_to_impact_seconds is manually measured from chart
- ✅ Event is not a duplicate of existing event

**REJECT if:**
- ❌ Source timestamp is >60s after spike (wrong source)
- ❌ Can't find any news at spike time (market noise, not event-driven)
- ❌ Source is tier-2/3 (Reddit, blog, unverified account)
- ❌ Text is summarized or paraphrased

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete research for each spike above
2. Add verified events to `verified_events_batch.json`
3. Run `python3 scripts/import_new_events_json.py`
4. Run `python3 scripts/build_verified_dataset.py` to fetch 1s price data
5. Run `python3 scripts/validation/validate_correlation.py` to verify quality
