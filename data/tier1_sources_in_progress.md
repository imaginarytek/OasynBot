### Events Found with Tier-1 Sources

#### 1. SEC vs Coinbase Lawsuit Announcement
**Spike Match:** Spike #2 (2023-06-06 01:15 UTC, Z=12.73σ, -7.39% DOWN)
**Event Date:** June 6, 2023, 12:30 PM (likely EDT)
**Source:** CoinDesk
**Tier-1:** YES (CoinDesk is tier-1 crypto news)
**Headline:** "SEC Sues Coinbase on Unregistered Securities Exchange Allegations"
**Author:** Nikhilesh De
**Verbatim Text:** "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued U.S crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) on allegations of violating federal securities law, a day after filing a similar suit against Binance. According to the SEC, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency simultaneously, arguing that it solicited customers, handled orders, allowed for bids and acted as an intermediary all at once. The suit named Coinbase, Inc. and Coinbase Global, Inc. as defendants, but did not name founder and CEO Brian Armstrong or any other executive. The Coinbase Platform merges three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets – those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. Yet, Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading disclosure requirements that Congress established for securities markets."

**Headline:** "Ripple, Crypto Industry Score Partial Win in SEC Court Fight Over XRP"
**Author:** Sandali Handagama
**Verbatim Text:** "Ripple scored a partial victory in its fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a court ruling that brought a modicum of regulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry. The sale of Ripple's XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts, the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled Thursday. But the institutional sale of the tokens did violate federal securities laws, the court said. XRP rallied on the news, and crypto exchange Gemini said it might now list the token, but early reads from legal experts suggest the ruling falls short of settling the question of whether and under what circumstances a digital asset meets the definition of a security under U.S. law. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has contended most of them do, and thus that they require issuers to go through a lengthy and expensive registration process before selling them to the public, and exchanges to register as broker-dealers before listing them. The industry has maintained that it is ambiguous how laws written during the analog era apply to an asset class born on the internet."

**Author:** Oliver Knight
**Verbatim Text:** "Bitcoin [BTC] quickly fell by more than 3% from its perch near $35,000 late Tuesday morning after the ticker for BlackRock's (BLK) spot bitcoin ETF – IBTC – was removed from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's (DTCC) website. The ticker's appearance on the DTCC site yesterday – rightly or wrongly – had investors speculating about imminent approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, thus playing a factor in BTC's sharp gain from the $30,000 area to more than $35,000. Data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) shows that open interest for bitcoin futures surged to a record high of $3.4 billion on Monday, demonstrating growing interest from institutional investors."

### Notes
- Several timestamp mismatches suggest we need to find the ORIGINAL announcements, not just the coverage
- For regulatory events (SEC lawsuits, court rulings), need to find official SEC.gov press releases or court filings with timestamps
- Many spikes occur BEFORE the CoinDesk articles are published, suggesting we need Bloomberg Terminal or Reuters wire services for exact times
- Without Twitter API, we're missing the precise second-level timestamps from official accounts

### Next Steps
1. Search for SEC.gov official press releases for regulatory events
2. Search for Bloomberg/Reuters coverage with more precise timestamps
3. For spikes without matches, use broader date range searches
4. Consider that some spikes may be technical/market microstructure rather than news-driven
